# Product Requirements Document: zupp - SEO Bookmarklet Tool

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023


## 1. Executive Summary

zupp is a bookmarklet-based SEO diagnostic tool that allows SEO marketers, content creators, and web developers to quickly check key SEO elements of a webpage with a single click.  The tool analyzes meta tags, page structure, content quality, and other crucial SEO factors, providing a concise report to identify areas for improvement.  The initial release will focus on core SEO elements; future iterations will incorporate advanced features like performance analysis via Lighthouse integration.


## 2. Problem Statement

SEO professionals spend significant time manually checking various aspects of a webpage's SEO health. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors.  zupp aims to streamline this process by providing a quick and efficient way to assess SEO performance directly within the browser, eliminating manual checks and improving overall efficiency.


## 3. User Personas and Use Cases

**Persona 1: SEO Marketer (Jin)**

* **Goal:** Quickly audit website pages for SEO issues before submitting to search engines.
* **Use Case:** Jin uses zupp to check the meta description and title tag length, identify broken links, and verify proper schema markup on a client's landing page.

**Persona 2: Content Creator (Su-jin)**

* **Goal:** Ensure that their blog posts are optimized for search engines before publishing.
* **Use Case:** Su-jin uses zupp to check for proper heading structure (H1-H6), the presence of alt text for images, and the use of semantic HTML elements.

**Persona 3: Web Developer (Tae-hyun)**

* **Goal:** Ensure websites are technically SEO-sound during development.
* **Use Case:** Tae-hyun uses zupp during development to check for proper meta tag implementation, canonical URLs, and mobile responsiveness.


## 4. Functional Requirements (Detailed)

The zupp bookmarklet will perform the following checks:

**4.1. Meta Information:**

* **Requirement:** Verify the presence and length of `<title>` tag (optimal length: under 60 characters).  Flag if missing or excessively long.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Correctly identifies the `<title>` tag, its length, and flags issues according to predefined thresholds.
* **Implementation Hint:** Use DOM parsing to extract the `<title>` content and length.

* **Requirement:** Verify the presence and length of `<meta name="description">` tag (optimal length: under 160 characters). Flag if missing or excessively long.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Correctly identifies the meta description, its length, and flags issues.

* **Requirement:** Identify the use of `rel="nofollow"` attribute in `<a>` tags.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Correctly identifies links with `rel="nofollow"`.

* **Requirement:** Detect broken links (404 errors). (This requires an additional HTTP request for each link – consider prioritizing).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Identifies a significant percentage of broken links.

**4.5. Image-Related Elements:**

* **Requirement:** Verify the presence of `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags. Flag missing `alt` attributes.

* **Requirement:** Verify the presence and correctness of `<meta name="viewport">` tag.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Correctly identifies and reports the content of the viewport meta tag.

* **Requirement:** (Basic Check) Detect if the page appears to be responsive (simple check – advanced analysis with Lighthouse is a future feature).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Provides a visual indication (e.g., pass/fail) based on a basic responsive check.

**4.7. Language and Internationalization:**

* **Requirement:** Verify the presence and correctness of `<html lang="...">` tag.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Correctly identifies the language specified in the HTML tag.

**4.8. Speed and Performance (Future Expansion):**

* **Requirement:** Integrate with Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights API (Future Feature).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Successfully retrieves and displays performance metrics from the chosen API.

**4.9. Other Elements:**

* **Requirement:** Check for the presence of structured data (Schema.org).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Correctly identifies the presence of schema.org structured data.

## 6. Technical Architecture Overview

The zupp bookmarklet will be a single JavaScript file that uses the browser's DOM API to analyze the webpage.  Results will be displayed within a modal or overlay on the page.  Future versions may incorporate server-side components for advanced features (Lighthouse integration).


## 7. API Specifications (If Applicable)

If Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights API integration is implemented, the relevant API documentation will be followed.


## 8. Database Schema (If Applicable)

Not applicable for the initial release.  Future versions might utilize a database for user data and analytics.


## 9. UI/UX Requirements

The results should be displayed in a clear and concise manner, using a combination of text, icons, and color-coding to highlight critical issues. The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.  A simple pass/fail indicator for each check is recommended.


## 10. Success Metrics and KPIs

* **Monthly Active Users (MAU):**  10,000
* **Average Bookmarklet Load Time:** Under 2 seconds
* **User Feedback (Surveys/Reviews):** Positive feedback rate above 80%


## 11. Timeline and Milestones

* **This Week:** Complete core functionality (meta tags, page structure, basic link analysis, image alt text).
* **Next Week:**  Implement remaining features (semantic HTML, mobile responsiveness check).
* **Following Week:** Thorough testing and bug fixing.  Release.


## 12. Risks and Mitigations

* **Risk:** Difficulty in accurately assessing page structure and content quality.
    * **Mitigation:**  Focus on clear, measurable criteria and use heuristics where necessary.  Prioritize the most critical checks initially.
* **Risk:** Slow bookmarklet load time due to complex analysis.
    * **Mitigation:** Optimize JavaScript code and minimize unnecessary DOM manipulations.  Prioritize features based on performance impact.
* **Risk:** Cross-browser compatibility issues.
    * **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing across major browsers.


## 13. Implementation Guidelines for AI Coding Tools

AI coding tools can be used to:

* **Generate JavaScript code:** For DOM parsing, data extraction, and result presentation.
* **Assist with error handling and exception management:**  Handle potential errors during DOM parsing and API calls.
* **Automate testing:**  Generate test cases to ensure cross-browser compatibility and accuracy.
* **Suggest code optimizations:** Improve the performance and efficiency of the bookmarklet code.

**Note:**  Prioritize the development of the core features first.  Advanced features (Lighthouse integration, broken link detection) can be added in subsequent iterations.  Regular testing and user feedback are crucial for successful implementation.
